# ISO Flags

The Unicode Consortium has made it possible to convert the two letter region codes (defined in ISO-3166, alpha2) into their flag representation, this library does this for you in JavaScript.

## Installation

```
$ npm install @konfirm/isoflag
```

## Usage

```
const Flag = require('@konfirm/isoflag');

const flagNL = Flag.factory('NL');
const flagBE = new Flag('BE');
```

### Creating an instance

The ISOFlag class provides two means to obtain an instance, the most obvious one being using the `new` syntax.

```js
const Flag = require('@konfim/isoflag');
const flagDE = new Flag('DE');
```

If you have a need for a lot of flag instances and/or want to be able to compare instances, you can use the `ISOFlag.factory` method, which caches instances.

```js
const Flag = require('@konfirm/isoflag');
const flagPO = Flag.factory('PO');
```

## API

### ISOFlag.factory(string iso)

The static `factory` method is used to create and cache instances for re-use. Use the `factory` method if you need/want to compare instances directly.

```js
const Flag = require('@konfirm/isoflag');
const flagES = Flag.factory('ES');

if (flagES === Flag.factory('es')) {
	//  both are the exact same instance
}
```

### ISOFlag.hasFlag(string iso)

The static `hasFlag` quickly determines whether or not an ISOFlag instance can be created for the specified ISO-3166 alpha2 code.

```js
const Flag = require('@konfirm/isoflag');

if (Flag.hasFlag('US')) {
	//  the 'US' region has a flag
}

if (Flag.hasFlag('QQ')) {
	//  this is never reached
} else {
	//  'QQ' is not a valid region :()
}
```

### flag.getUnicode()

Obtain the unicode character index representing the flag. These codepoints represent characters like ðŸ‡· and ðŸ‡·, which - when used combined - is turned into ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¸ (dependending on your font-set, you may not see a flag);

```js
const Flag = require('@konfirm/isoflag');
const flagRS = new Flag('RS');

const indices = flagRS.getUnicode();

// [127479, 127480]
```

### flag.toHTMLEntities()

Characters in HTML can be represented by their character index within the unicde standard, ISOFlag provides the hexadecimal notation of these entities.

```js
const Flag = require('@konfirm/isoflag');
const flagCH = new Flag('CH');

const entities = flagCH.toHTMLEntities();

// &#x1f1e8;&#x1f1ed;
```

### flag.toUnicodeSymbol()

Represent the flag as its unicode emoji

```js
const Flag = require('@konfirm/isoflag');
const flagDK = new Flag('DK');

const symbol = flagDK.toUnicodeSymbol();

// ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°
```

### String(flag)

Flag instances can be turned into string, it is the same as using `toUnicodeSymbol()` on the instance

```js
const Flag = require('@konfirm/isoflag');
const flagSE = new Flag('SE');

const symbol = String(flagSE);

// ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª
```
